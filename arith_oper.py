# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b
# Add code to print three lines where:


def arith(i, j):
#     The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
    print(i+j)
#     The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
    print(i-j)
#     The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
    print(i*j)

#     b = int(input())
#     arith(a, b)
