# Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. 
# If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

#     The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
#         The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
#             The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.


def is_leap(year):
    leap = False

    if (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0) 
    
    # Write your logic here
    
    return leap
